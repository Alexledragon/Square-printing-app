# Square printing app
» Easter eggs «
----------------------------------------
 Did you know that the application does feature a few easter eggs?
 If you want to find them, i recommend you to check the information tab that you can open right before the end of the program, by pressing spacebar instead of closing the app. That info tab should tell you everything you need to find all 4; if you did not find some already.

» Why did i make that program? «
----------------------------------------
 I wanted to learn coding and specifically C# to eventually be able to make video games.
 With that intend, i was recommended to try making a small console application with one simple purpose: printing squares of different sizes.
 
 After reading the C# documentation a tiny bit, i started typing and learnt on the spot, i enjoyed it so i kept adding details and wanted to try polishing this app to a reasonable extent... Eventually this is what i ended up with: my first project and application. The code itself may be a bit messy since i used it to explore and experiment, but it seems to work
 
 » Do i plan to update or expand the program? «
----------------------------------------
 As it is right now, not really.
 I don't have much of a reason to do it since this was meant to be my introduction to C#.
 I know i could make the code way more compact and tidy or make the program better, but i think it's better for me to leave it behind and remember it as where it all began, while moving forward to other projects and ideas.
 
 » Why writing such a long about me for a small console app? «
----------------------------------------
 I kinda felt like it.
