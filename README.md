# Square printing app

» Easter eggs «
 Did you know that the application does feature a few easter eggs?
 If you want to find them, i recommend you to check the information tab that you can open right before the end of the program, by pressing spacebar instead of closing the app. That info tab should tell you everything you need to find all 4; if you did not find some already.

» Why did i make that program? «
 I wanted to learn coding and specifically C# to eventually be able to make video games.
 With that intend, i was recommended to try making a small console application with one simple purpose: printing squares of different sizes.
 
 After reading the C# documentation a tiny bit, i started typing and learnt on the spot, i enjoyed it so i kept adding details and wanted to try polishing this app to a reasonable extent... Eventually this is what i ended up with: my first project and application.
